# Tableau Dashboard Project
In this Tableau project, I employed a range of advanced functions, measures, and calculated fields to create insightful visualizations. The objective was to analyze complex datasets and derive actionable insights.

Key components of the project included:

Functions Utilized: Implemented various Tableau functions to enhance data manipulation and visualization, including aggregation functions, logical functions, and date functions.

Measures: Developed and utilized several key measures to quantify performance metrics and trends, ensuring clarity in data interpretation.

Calculated Fields: Created calculated fields to generate new insights, allowing for custom metrics and comparative analyses tailored to specific business questions.

The resulting visualizations provided a comprehensive view of the data, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
